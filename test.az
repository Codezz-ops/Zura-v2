// 2**9
// this reads left to right,
// So it reads 2 to the power of 9
// 2*9 = 512 or 
// 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 512

// You can even do this
// 2**(9-1)
// Which is the same as saying 2**8
// So if you had a function that took a number
// and you wanted to get the next power of 2
// you could do this
